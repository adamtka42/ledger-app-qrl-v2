# Technical Specification

## About

This documentation describes the APDU messages interface to communicate with the QRL v2.0 application.

The application covers the following functionalities :

- Get a public QRL v2.0 address given a BIP 32 path
- Sign a QRL v2.0 transaction given a BIP 32 path and RLP encoded transaction data
- Retrieve the QRL v2.0 app version
- Retrieve the QRL v2.0 app name

The application interface can be accessed over HID or BLE

## APDUs

### GET QRL v2.0 PUBLIC ADDRESS

#### Description

This command returns the public QRL v2.0 address for the given BIP 32 path.

The address can be verified on the device before being returned.

### SIGN QRL v2.0 TRANSACTION

#### Description

This command signs a QRL v2.0 transaction after having the user validate the transactions parameters.

The signing session becomes active only after the first block's BIP32 path has
been validated. Transaction data blocks (`P1=01` or `P1=02, P2=00`) are accepted
only while that session is receiving data. If the signing handler rejects a
path, transaction data, or command parameters, the session is discarded. The
host must send a new first block before retrying; continuing a discarded session
returns `SW_BAD_STATE` (`B007`). A new first block also replaces any previous
signing session, including when the new path is empty or malformed.

First and continuation blocks (`P1=00/01`) require `P2=00`. Signature export
uses `P1=02, P2=01..11` (hexadecimal) with an empty payload and is authorized
only for the current approved transaction after successful signature
self-verification. An unfinished export from a previous request does not
authorize a new receiving session. Rejected or failed signing requests are
discarded before returning their status word.

Resetting a request also clears the persistent signature-export flag. This
happens on app startup, when a new signing or public-key request replaces the
old session, and when a signing request fails or is rejected. An already clear
flag is not written again, avoiding unnecessary NVM writes. Session-state
checks remain mandatory independently of this flag.

The input data is the RLP encoded transaction streamed to the device in 255 bytes maximum data chunks. The device parses and hashes the transaction incrementally as the chunks arrive, so there is no fixed maximum transaction size (only a 64 KiB sanity cap applies).

As the signature size exceeds maximum APDU response length, responses will be chunked with max size of 258 bytes each. The main app should request each chunk manually with index from 0-17, where the first chunk will be automatically returned after the last transaction data is sent and the signature is computed.
